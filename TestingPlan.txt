Testing Plan:
************

Knowing that I had to capture multiple cases of inputs from regex, I had to develop a testing plan that would leave me satisfied with as close to an error-free program as I could. 

To accomplish this, I created multiple test documents designed to showcase what sections of the document pass or fail based on the assignment criteria.

I ran through plenty of senarios that would check if relevent tags were nested inside of irrelevent tags, I test mismatched tags so that error messages would display and tested sections that should work. 

I used large documents to cover as many cases as possible, for each regular expression, and ran tests until I was satisfied with the pass/fail ratio.
