**************
Scanner Readme
**************

This directory containts files required to build a scanner for SGML.

The scanner will tokenize open and close tags and then sort relevant information and label it.

**********
USER GUIDE:
**********

$make
$java Scanner < filename.txt

$make clean

****************************
ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS:
****************************
- Assume the user is inputting a .txt file
- Uses appropriate SGML format

- When an irrelevent open-tag does not have a matching irrelevent close-tag, the program is locked.
- Attributes within open-tags are not processed, and will lead to the above issue.
- Hypenated words with apostrophes are considered hyphenated with an apostraphe as punctuation.

*******************
FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:
*******************
- Implement more user proofing (such as throwing errors for issues like "this'is'an'error")
